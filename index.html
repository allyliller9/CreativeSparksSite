      <h2>Why Creative Sparks?</h2>
      <h3>Girls Deserve More Representation in STEM</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="National Science Foundation, 2023">Only 28% of the science and engineering workforce is female</span></li>
        <li><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Code.org, 2023">Girls are 5x less likely than boys to pursue computer science by high school</span></li>
        <li><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="American Association of University Women, 2022">Women hold just 16% of engineering jobs</span></li>
        <li><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023">STEM job growth is outpacing other fields by 8.8%, but the gender gap is widening</span></li>
        <li><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Pew Research Center, 2023">Only 24% of STEM workers are women, despite making up 50% of the college-educated workforce</span></li>

      </ul>
      
      <h3>The Power of Early Intervention</h3>
      <p><strong>Summer camps and early STEM exposure make a huge difference!</strong></p>

        <li><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Girl Scout Research Institute, 2022">83% of girls who attend STEM camps report increased confidence in math and science</span></li>
        <li><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Harvard Business Review, 2023">Early exposure to female STEM role models increases girls' likelihood of pursuing STEM by 42%</span></li>
        <li><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="AAUW Educational Foundation, 2022">Girls who experience collaborative, creative STEM projects are 65% more likely to stay engaged through high school</span></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>This camp exists to close that gap—and spark confidence, curiosity, and creativity in every girl. When we start early, we create lasting change!</strong></p>
