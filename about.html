      <div class="mission-statement">
        <p>We started Creative Sparks in 2021 after realizing how few fun, engaging spaces existed for girls to get involved in STEM. Representation in science and technology is still way too low for women—especially young girls—and we knew we could do something about it. This camp combines our love for STEM with creativity, community, and confidence-building. Our goal is to help every camper see herself as a future scientist, engineer, inventor, or artist.</p>

        <h3>Ally's Bio</h3>
        <p>Hi! I'm Ally, and I'm passionate about science, creativity, and making learning fun. I plan to become a chemical engineer because I love building things, exploring how materials work, and applying chemistry to real-world problems. I founded Creative Sparks to give girls the chance to experiment and explore STEM and art in a space that's hands-on, inclusive, and exciting.</p>

        <h3>Anna's Bio</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Anna! I'm fascinated by how the human body works, and I dream of becoming a surgeon someday. I help run Creative Sparks to show girls that science isn't just for textbooks—it's something we can touch, build, and be proud of. Whether we're doing cool experiments or making art, I want every camper to feel confident and inspired.</p>
