    <h2>Girls Deserve More Representation in STEM</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Only 28% of the science and engineering workforce is female (National Science Foundation, 2023)</li>
      <li>Girls are 5x less likely than boys to pursue computer science by high school (Code.org, 2023)</li>
      <li>Women hold just 16% of engineering jobs (American Association of University Women, 2022)</li>
      <li>STEM job growth is outpacing other fields by 8.8%, but the gender gap is widening (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023)</li>
      <li>Only 24% of STEM workers are women, despite making up 50% of the college-educated workforce (Pew Research Center, 2023)</li>
      <li>Women earn only 82 cents for every dollar earned by men in STEM fields (Census Bureau, 2022)</li>
      <li>Girls who lose interest in STEM typically do so between ages 9-14 - our camp's target age range! (Microsoft Research, 2022)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The Power of Early Intervention</h2>
    <p><strong>Summer camps and early STEM exposure make a huge difference!</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Girls who participate in hands-on STEM activities before age 12 are 3x more likely to pursue STEM careers (National Girls Collaborative Project, 2023)</li>
      <li>83% of girls who attend STEM camps report increased confidence in math and science (Girl Scout Research Institute, 2022)</li>
      <li>Early exposure to female STEM role models increases girls' likelihood of pursuing STEM by 42% (Harvard Business Review, 2023)</li>
      <li>Girls who experience collaborative, creative STEM projects are 65% more likely to stay engaged through high school (AAUW Educational Foundation, 2022)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>This camp exists to close that gapâ€”and spark confidence, curiosity, and creativity in every girl. When we start early, we create lasting change!</strong></p>
